TriSys Apex Games
-----------------

Games created in 2020 to demonstrate the plug-in nature of TriSys Apex.

Any plug-in can be developed for Apex in the Developer Studio which is what makes TriSys Apex the ultimate enterprise CRM/ERP solution.

Each game can be invoked in Apex by adding these to the custom forms.json file as shown in the demo logins.

Each game consists of an HTML file for the control markup and JavaScript files for the code.
